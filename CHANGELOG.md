<!--
Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry is required to include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The tag should consist of where the change is being made ex. (x/staking), (store)
The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLIs, Protobuf, gRPC and REST routes used by end-users/reporters.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.
