## Context

ADR's capture the discussion behind several architecture and design decision for Layer. Layer will eventually be just referred to as Tellor, however while it's under development we'll call it Layer to differentiate between the current Tellor protocol design and the future Tellor chain design.

ADRs key:

* 001-999: ADRs covering other architecture design discussions that don't include tokenomics or the bridge (may create further categories as these expand)
* 1000s: ADRs relating to tokenomics (delegation, rewards, tips, usage of staked tokens, voting, fees, etc...)
* 2000s: ADRs relating to bridging data (bridge, vote extenstion, validators, etc...)
