## Authors

## Changelog

- 2024-04-01: initial version
- 2024-04-18: Added category for token bridge to distinguish between the token bridge an the data bridge.

## Context

ADR's capture the discussion behind several architecture and design decision for Layer. Layer will eventually be just referred to as Tellor, however while it's under development we'll call it Layer to differentiate between the current Tellor protocol design and the future Tellor chain design.

ADRs key:

001-999: ADRs are a catch all for other architecture design discussions (may create further categories as these expand)
1000s: ADRs relating to tokenomics (delegation, rewards, tips, usage of staked tokens, voting, fees, etc...)
2000s: ADRs about bridging data (bridging data, vote extension, validators, etc...) 
3000s: ADRs include information about the token bridge
